## Live Tournament System

The app connects to a live tournament simulation backend that runs continuous hourly tournaments:

- **:00** - Round of 16 (8 matches)
- **:15** - Quarter-finals (4 matches)
- **:30** - Semi-finals (2 matches)
- **:45** - Final (1 match)

### API Integration

The frontend integrates with the live tournament API:

- `GET /api/live/status` - Full system status
- `GET /api/live/tournament` - Current tournament state
- `GET /api/live/matches` - Active matches
- `GET /api/live/events` - SSE stream for real-time updates

## State Management

The app uses Zustand for state management:

- `useLiveStore` - Manages tournament state, matches, events, and connection status
- Real-time updates via SSE events
- Snapshot-based recovery for reconnections
